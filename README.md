# How to Build a Cool Data Science Logo

If you ask me, data science is a whole lot about visualization. Therefore, when you want to brand yourself as a data scientist, you should convey this through a visually appealing logo. Today, I would like to share some insights about how to design a cool data science logo, using trigonometry and the beauty of randomness.

## Getting Started
